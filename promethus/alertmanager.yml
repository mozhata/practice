# An inhibition rule is a rule that mutes an alert matching a set of matchers under the condition that an alert exists that matches another set of matchers. Both alerts must have a set of equal labels.
# Inhibition rules allow to mute a set of alerts given that another alert is
# firing.
# We use this to mute any warning-level notifications if the same alert is 
# already critical.

# - source_match:

#   target_match:
#     severity: 'warning'
